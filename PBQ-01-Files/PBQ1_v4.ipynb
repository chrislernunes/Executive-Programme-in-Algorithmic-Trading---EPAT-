I would also strongly urge you to read through and play around with this file before the lecture._\n\n***I say this so that you can derive maximum benefit from listening to this lecture. If you're a newbie to programming, don't worry. You CAN do this. Yes, it's going to be a little challenging. Yes, you'll need to put in the extra yards. But I can assure you, it's very realizable.***"

      "source": "### Some philosophizing on programming\n\nThe good news is that coding is certainly a learnable skill. If you put in the effort and take your time, you will learn to program. It'll be difficult at the outset but hang in there. A simple principle of learning is that to get familiar or comfortable with anything, it has to start coming to you naturally. And that comes with practice.\n\nSo the first piece of advice: **practise everyday**. Even it's just half an hour. Open your Python terminal. I don't care what you prefer. It could be the Spyder IDE. Or Jupyter Notebook. Or Jupyter Lab. Or the Python/IPython console. Anything really. *One simple way to do this is to take this file and mess with the code I've given you. Change values and see what happens. Playing around with it will get you accustomed to Python syntax and also help you figure out limitations. All of this will help you learn.* Keep at it and it'll eventually start getting more enjoyable. You can teach yourself to do almost anything with this method. Whether it's Python, or Squash or Japanese or lion taming (may be not the last one).\n\nSecond piece of advice: **learning to research topics online**. This is something I emphasize quite a bit as an instructor/educator. I say this because what I want is for you to eventually learn to become independent learners. In today's day and age, we have a lot of resources which are available to us at the click of a button. The online Python community is incredibly helpful and enthusiastic. The [official Python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/) is regularly updated and useful albeit a bit technical. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a fantastic place to look up answers to questions. This could be anything from the most basic to the very advanced. You can be almost certain that any question that pops into your head has been asked by someone before and been answered too. Even [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) can be useful. Or a plain old Google search.\n\nThird piece of advice: **borrow ideas/concepts you like or find useful**. Through your Pythonic journey, in class or otherwise (I encourage you to consume all kinds of resources be it books, online links, youtube videos, etc. The process of learning can be quite arbitrary and the only way you'll know what helps you learn most effectively is by trying different ones on for size.), there'll be snippets of code you'll read or run that look like something you might want to use. You may not even understand it completely, but note it and save it somewhere. You should go back to your notes from time to time and review it. You'll be surprised at how soon we forget things if we don't keep relooking at them every now and then.\n\n\nIf you've signed up for a demanding course like EPAT, I'm quite sure you have the will to learn and work hard.\n\n\n### A couple of suggestions before we begin today's journey.\n\n1. This is a living, breathing document. For each of you. What that means is, I want you to **annotate it** with whatever comments you want. Things you forget. Things I may mention in class. That link I may casually reference during a lecture. May be stuff you want to further emphasize just so it sticks in your head. \n2. I have shared this document with you so that you have a touchstone while we go through our class. You have here both the explanations and the code. However, while you learn to code in Python or for that matter any language, **please type each line in**. Let me repeat that. Type every line. I cannot emphasize this enough. We may resort to copy-paste here during the lecture in order to save time and cover more topics. But when you're reviewing your notes, you should be typing. That's how you'll learn actively. The idea is to train yourself to read, write and understand code. And for this, it's important that both your fingers and your brain gets used to it."

You can use whichever environment you prefer (Spyder IDE, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).\n\nDue to paucity of time, I will likely **not be covering interpreting errors at any significant length**. However, learning to do so is a very **important part of your quest to becoming a good programmer (and eventually an algorithmic or quantitative trader)**. Please go through [this](https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/dealing-python-error-exceptions/) and [this](https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/python-exception/).

Before defining code blocks, let's first look at what a Python program consists of. \n\nAny program we write consists of a set of statements. We can think of a statement as *the fundamental unit of a Python program*. A number of statements can be grouped into a larger chunk called a block. In fact, some would even say that a 'block' of code can be treated as one compound statement.\n\nSome of the more complex constructs that we encounter like functions or methods are composed of blocks.\n\nYou'll understand them as we look at various examples now. Python can identify the different code blocks in any program **only from indentations**. \n\nThe standard size for indentations is [4 spaces](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation). In IDEs like Spyder or Jupyter Notebook, the tab key takes care of this.\n\nImportant points to remember:\n- The line before the start of any code block *always ends in a colon*.\n- All lines of code in a code block must have *the same amount of indentation*.\n\n```python\n\n## the if statement (Branches)\n\npeople = 10\nsandwiches = 12\ncoffees = 8\n\nif (sandwiches > people):\n    print(\"We've ordered too much food!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Have we ordered too few?\")\n    \nif coffees > people:\n    print(\"That's too much coffee\")\nelif coffees < people:\n    print(\"Too many people!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Ahh.

The key purpose that `NumPy` serves is fast processing with low memory overheads.\nThe data is stored as an array data type which is called a `numpy.ndarray`. These arrays are somewhat like native Python lists, except that the data must be homogeneous (all elements of the same type). \n\n`NumPy` is best utilized when the computations that have to be performed can be **vectorized**. Vectorization essentially involves the elimination of a `for` loop in performing the task. Meaning, rather than performing the same task sequentially hundreds of times, it is done so batchwise. For ex. computing moving averages for an entire array, or generating a sequence of random values."
